- [Include sub-topics where relevant]

## Output Format
When responding to a research request, provide:
- **Evidence summary** — factual findings relevant to the question
- **Proof points** — specific data, claims, or examples that can support messaging
- **Caveats and guardrails** — what cannot be claimed, what requires qualification
