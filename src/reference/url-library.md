# Toyota Fleet & Business – URL Reference Library

## Purpose
These URLs are reference sources for the agent system. Claude Code should use web_fetch to pull content from relevant URLs and inject it as context when agents need brand, product, or positioning information. This ensures agents stay aligned with Toyota's live website messaging.

## How Agents Should Use These

| Agent | Primary Use | When to Fetch |
|-------|------------|---------------|
| **Briefing** | Validate campaign context against live brand positioning | When structuring briefs involving specific products or audiences |
| **Strategy** | Extract proof points, messaging cues, and positioning language | When generating strategic direction or researching competitive context |
| **Copy** | Reference tone, CTA styles, product descriptions, and benefit language | When writing copy to ensure alignment with website messaging |
| **Compliance** | Cross-check claims, disclaimers, and legal language against live site | When validating claims about products, emissions, charging, or finance |

## Usage Notes for Claude Code

1. **Don't fetch all URLs upfront** — only fetch what's relevant to the current campaign input
2. **Cache intelligently** — product pages change infrequently, offers pages change often
3. **Compliance Agent should always fetch** the relevant product page and the electrification page when validating claims
4. **Strategy Agent should fetch** the fleet manager page for proof points and case studies
5. **Copy Agent should fetch** the relevant product page to align language and CTAs with live site messaging
6. **Time-sensitive content** (offers, news) should be fetched fresh each time
